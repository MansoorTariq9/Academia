# Project Title

A comprehensive analysis and visualization project integrating data scraping, API usage, machine learning, and advanced visualizations.

## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage a variety of data sources and methodologies to extract insights, predict outcomes, and visualize data in a meaningful way. It encompasses data scraping, API interactions, data cleaning and formatting, machine learning predictions, and creating compelling visualizations.

## Project Structure

- **API_to_Script.py**: Python script for fetching data from specified APIs.
- **APIs.txt**: Text file listing all APIs used in the project.
- **Data scrapper.R**: R script for scraping data from web sources.
- **formatter.py**: Python script for data cleaning and formatting.
- **Project_MachineLearning.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook detailing the machine learning models used, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **Project_Visualization.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for data visualization, showcasing the insights derived from the data through various charts and graphs.
- **scripts.txt**: Text file listing additional scripts used in the project.
- **Visualizations.pbix**: Power BI file containing advanced data visualizations.
- **websites used.txt**: Text file listing websites from which data was scraped.

## How to Use

1. **Data Acquisition**: Use `API_to_Script.py` and `Data scrapper.R` for data collection from APIs and websites listed in `APIs.txt` and `websites used.txt`.
2. **Data Preparation**: Run `formatter.py` to clean and format the raw data into a structured form.
3. **Analysis and Modeling**: Open `Project_MachineLearning.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment to view the machine learning workflow.
4. **Visualization**: Access `Project_Visualization.ipynb` for data visualization notebooks and `Visualizations.pbix` for Power BI dashboards.
5. **Additional Resources**: Refer to `scripts.txt` for any additional scripts that were utilized in the project.

## Requirements

- Python (for `.py` scripts and Jupyter notebooks)
- R (for `.R` scripts)
- Power BI (for `.pbix` files)
- Relevant Python and R libraries as per the scripts and notebooks

## Installation

Instructions on setting up your environment to run the scripts, notebooks, and Power BI files, including the installation of necessary libraries and tools.
